# <Challenge-1>

## Description
The challenge was to refactor the existing site to make it more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access it using assisstive technologies. In order to do that I made sure all the links are functioning correctly, increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each elemenet or section of the page.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](C:\Users\chadunnett\desktop\challenge\Develop\assets\images\Screenshot 2022-08-26 132444.png)
    ```
